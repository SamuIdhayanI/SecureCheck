# 🚨 SecureCheck: Digital Police Check Post Registry

SecureCheck is an advanced digital police check post registry system designed to modernize and secure check post operations through real-time data analytics, centralized logging, and predictive insights. This project replaces inefficient manual systems with a robust SQL-backed architecture and a Python-powered Streamlit dashboard.

## 📌 Overview

Manual logging of vehicle checks can lead to inefficiencies and missed threats. **SecureCheck** solves this by:
- Providing a centralized SQL-based database for all police stop records.
- Offering real-time insights through a Streamlit dashboard.
- Enabling predictive analytics for violations and outcomes.
- Supporting crime pattern analysis for improved law enforcement coordination.

## 🧾 Dataset

- `traffic_stops_with_vehicle_number.csv`  
  Contains real-world traffic stop data, including columns like:
  - `stop_date`, `stop_time`, `country_name`, `driver_gender`, `driver_age_raw`, `driver_age`, `driver_race`, `violation_raw`, `violation`, `search_conducted`, `search_type`, `stop_outcome`, `is_arrested`, `stop_duration`, `drugs_related_stop`, `vehicle_number`.
